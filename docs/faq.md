# Frequently Asked Questions

## What happened to the FAIMS Mobile Platform?

The Field Acquired Information Management Systems (FAIMS) Mobile Platform was retired in 2022. The platform was established by archaeologists in 2012 to support the capture and management of digital field data in difficult terrain.

The original software, built in 2014 to run on Android only was rebuilt from the ground up with the assistance from the the Australian Research Data Commons ([ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au/)), [doi: 10.47486/PL110](https://dx.doi.org/10.47486/PL110). and our [partners](https://faims.edu.au/partners). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).


## Who owns the data?

You own the data. Fieldmark runs the software that allows you to collect data but does not take ownership of, nor claim any right to use, data collected with the App. We do not share data with third parties.

## Who can access my data?

Only the Administrator of the Notebook can access data in it. For the purposes of training or assisted support, Fieldmark technical staff may access to the data but this will only be conducted with explicit consent.
