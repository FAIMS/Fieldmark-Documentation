# Exporting your data

:::{caution}
The current version of Fieldmark (released December 2022) supports export from the Browser only, using a third-party service. Integrated export is coming in late 2023.
:::

## Available Exports
Data can be exported from Fieldmark into .csv, .kml, .json and other formats, as needed.

## Attachments
Images, files and folders are renamed in accordance with the record's chosen identifier, saving time when you return from the field.
