# Synchronisation

While working online, or within range of an offline server, records will be continuously synchronised. If working offline and without a standalone server, records will be stored on the local device until the next opportunity to synchronise. Users can choose whether or not to synchronise large files and attachments.

:::{caution} Important!
Note that Fieldmark must be open for synchronisation to work. To verify your records have synced, check them in a different computer.
