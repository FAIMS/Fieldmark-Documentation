# Mapping

Get to know how geospatial data is captured and used in Fieldmark

## Data Capture

Fieldmark can capture geospatial data in two ways:

1. A single point
2. A bounding box drawn on a map

## Basemaps

By default, Fieldmark will display a base map sourced from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) for any map field. (You must connect to the internet before going offline to see the map.)

Functionality to display custom geotiffs is currently in beta testing.  

## Export

Geospatial data will be exported in .kml and .geojson formats.
